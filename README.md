# MatSim-Dataset
The MatSim dataset includes large-scale collections of synthetic images for material self-similarity and a diverse natural image benchmark to test the ability of the net to identify material states and subclasses using one or a few examples. This dataset is designed to address the general issue of one-shot material retrieval without restrictions on material types, settings, and environments. The main focus is on distinguishing between states of materials and identifying fine-grained categories such as rotten vs. ripe or coffee vs. cocoa. Additionally, we created a second adversarial benchmark to test the net's ability to recognize materials without association with objects or environments. This benchmark involves covering objects with random materials to create uncorrelated material-object associations.
