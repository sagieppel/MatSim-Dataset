# MatSim-Dataset
MatSim Dataset for One-Shot recognition of any material anywhere.
Our hypothesis is that training a Siamese net to identify the same material texture on different objects and environments will allow the net to recognize materials in any setting. While material types are not always matched to a single texture, we assume that a diverse enough training set will force the net to learn a general representation of materials and their properties. The main advantage of this self-similarity approach is that when applied to synthetic data, it can be used to generate an unlimited amount of data with no human effort. In addition, it can be easily expanded to materials mixtures and gradual transitions. The main challenge is the need for a large and highly diverse dataset to prevent the net from overfitting to specific materials or environments.
